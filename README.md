- 👋 Hi, I’m @kimsarsem
- 👀 I’m interested in starting a career in data science.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics on IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate course on Coursera. And I am planning to start projects to practice the new skills I learned, and they will be posted here.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects to practice, practice, and practice!
- 📫 You can reach me by commenting on my projects.
