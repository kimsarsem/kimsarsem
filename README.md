	Date: **Wednesday, March 8, 2023**
	Context: Second update since README conception. As I settle into my current job, I realize that I'm satisfied with the Tableau skills I have and need to learn other skills to call myself a holistic data analysis like python/sql/r. I want to get comfortable with predictive models and more advanced visualization tools like D3.

🔷 UPDATE ON OLD GOALS:
	1. Figure out how to post on github (March 2023): still new to it but I can say I figured it out
	2. 20 creations on Tableau Public (January 2023): currently at 10
	3. Datacamp Data Analyst Professional certified (Februaru 2023): slowed down on datacamp :( need to get back on it
	4. Get started on Data Scientist Profesional on datacamp (February 2023): slowed down on datacamp :( need to get back on it
	5. Get a job using more python and SQL: work in progress
	6. Get a full time job: work in progress
	7. Coding challenge!: signed up for one... didn't submit
	
🔷 NEW SET OF GOALS:
	1. Finish majority of Udemy courses
	2. 5 things on github
	3. Understand predictive models
	4. Comfortable with python and SQL


🔶 Projects Topics:
1. Kaggle datasets - aim to be the same level as bootcamp projects

	Date: **Sunday, October 30, 2022 **
	Context: First update since README conception. Building Data Analyst skills in python, R, SQL, and Tableau. Just got Tableau Data Analyst certified yesterday! 

🔷 UPDATE ON OLD GOALS:
	1. Complete Coursera's IBM Data Science Professional Certificate (March 1, 2022)... Did not complete because of technical issues on Coursera (I was scoring 100% without even doing work)
	2. Start coding project for practice on Github (March 10, 2022)... ok still not sure how to use Github
	3. Enter coding challenge (March 30, 2022)... never happened, but still a goal of mine! I don't feel ready right now.
	4. Use Kaggle data for project... haven't pulled a dataset from kaggle yet...
	5. Enter Kaggle coding challenge... not accomplished yet, but still a goal of mine! I need more time to build confidence in coding.
	6. Determine top 3 Data Science tools to really focus on... SQL, Excel (Pivot Table, Power BI), Tableau Data Analyst... I have a much better grasp on this! 
	7. Compelete Udemy's Tableau Data Analyst Certificate Course (June 2022)... DONE AND CERTIFIED!
	8. Create product on Tableau Public and post publically (May 2022)... DONE! Leaning on #workoutwednesday. Great addition to resume. Keep posting!
	9. Complete Udemy's Tableu Course (April 2022)... DONE AND CERTIFIED!
	10. Get THE job you love! (Not just any job... THE job!)... I work at Salesforce as a Data Analyst with the Global Enablement team. I am so beyond happy with my job because it's great work and I have an awesome boss/team, but the work life balance is better than I could've dreamed of when I started my transition out of the army. I live with Matt, work remote, and am saving a lot of mooney. It's a contracting gig that I just got extended to the end of January 2023, and I really hope to get a FTE role!
